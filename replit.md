# Overview

This is a Streamlit-based audio processing application that allows users to upload and process audio files. The application provides a web interface for handling MP3 and WAV audio files with size validation and processing capabilities. It uses PyDub for audio manipulation and includes progress tracking for user feedback during file processing operations.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit for web interface
- **Layout**: Wide layout configuration with custom page settings
- **User Interface**: File upload components with real-time validation and progress indicators
- **User Experience**: Progress bars and status text for operation feedback

## Backend Architecture
- **Core Processing**: Python-based audio processing using PyDub library
- **File Handling**: Temporary file management for secure audio processing
- **Validation Layer**: Multi-tier validation including file format, extension, and size checks
- **Audio Processing**: AudioSegment-based manipulation with normalization effects

## Data Storage
- **Temporary Storage**: Uses Python's tempfile module for secure temporary file handling
- **Memory Management**: In-memory audio processing with BytesIO streams
- **File Constraints**: 100MB file size limit for practical performance

## Audio Processing Pipeline
- **Supported Formats**: MP3 and WAV file formats
- **Processing Chain**: File validation → temporary storage → PyDub processing → normalization
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with user-friendly error messages
